# Mini-Projects
This repository contains all the snips of code that I create while learning different Python packages

## Interactive_Dictionary:
  An interactive dictionary that takes any word from a user, extracts data from a JSON dataset, and returns the definition of the word. It also accounts for misspelled words.
  ### What I learned :
  - Working with JSON
  - difflib package
    
## Website Blocker:
  A python script that operates in the background to block user access to certain websites at certain intervals of time to boost productivity and avoid distraction. It can be scheduled to auto-start at startup with the help of taskscheduler and the script can be edited to work with different websites and different intervals of time. Side note : It needs to be run with high privileges.
   ### What I learned:
   -  System file manipulation
   -  datetime package
   
## Webmap Population:
  A python based webmap which uses Folium to implement the webmap functionalities and various folium features to add polygonal layers based on the World Population and also displays position of all volcanoes in USA. It is a layered map and uses OpenStreetMap and GeoJson for presentation of the datasets.
   ### What I learned:
   -  folium library
   -  layer control
   -  GeoJson
